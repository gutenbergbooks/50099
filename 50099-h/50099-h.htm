<p class="center">ACT I.
</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sir Joseph Balsted's</span> <i>study, in his house in Hans
Place</i>.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Treable</span>, <span class="smcap">Margaret's</span> <i>companion, a faded
lady of uncertain age, is fingering the photograph
on the mantelpiece</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Martelli</span>,
<i>the housekeeper, a grim-faced, elderly woman,
dressed in stiff black silk, opens the door and
enters</i> <span class="smcap">L. 3 E.</span> <span class="smcap">Miss Treable</span>, <i>absorbed in a
photograph she holds in her hand, does not
notice her</i>. <span class="smcap">Mrs. Martelli</span> <i>coughs emphatically</i>.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>turning</i>) Oh!... Dear
Mrs. Martelli, do you know who this is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>shortly</i>) Sir Joseph's sister.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> What an angelic face! The outline
so pure. Such heavenly eyes. (<i>returns</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and
puts frame back</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) She was marked with smallpox,
and had a pronounced squint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>disconcerted</i>) Ah! I have noticed
these photographs before. I have a passion for
photographs. This one&mdash;? (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>&mdash;<i>she takes
up another</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<i>takes photo from</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span>) Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Joseph's mother. The other ladies are his cousin,
his aunt by marriage, and&mdash;me. (<span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> <i>goes</i>
<span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>with surprise</i>) You!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<i>with dignity</i>) My late husband,
Captain Martelli, of his Majesty's Indian army,
was a friend of Sir Joseph's (<span class="smcap">C.</span>). I trust you
find nothing remarkable in his widow's photograph
reposing on Sir Joseph's mantelpiece?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>comes down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and sits</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>chair</i>)
Oh, not at all, not at all.... My father was Canon
Treable&mdash;he preached before the Queen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<i>puts photo back</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and comes
down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) So I have frequently heard. But I
admit it is a theme on which one cannot dwell
too often. None the less I consider it my duty, as
Sir Joseph's housekeeper, to inform Canon
Treable's daughter that this room is, as it were,
consecrated to Sir Joseph.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> <i>rises and crosses</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>and sits on stool</i>.)
</p>

<p>And that it is his wish, his formally expressed
instruction, that none but myself should enter it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<i>to desk</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) I allow no housemaid
here&mdash;I dust it myself. Sir Joseph, in common
with most legal gentlemen, is partial to dust, but
I control his partiality. So you understand&mdash;(<i>down</i>
<span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> But the Courts have risen to-day,
dear Mrs. Martelli! The Long Vacation, they
call it, do they not? For nigh on three months
Sir Joseph ceases to be the brilliant advocate;
Parliament is not sitting, so the House will not
hear his inspired accents&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> My accents may be less inspired,
but they rest on authority; and I beg you to heed
them. This room is private.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>sweetly</i>) I can quite understand
that, to the servants, it is a sanctuary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> To the servants, and the upper
servants, Miss Treable. You and I are both upper
servants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>rise, indignantly</i>) Mrs. Martelli!
This is intolerable. I am dear Margaret's companion&mdash;(<i>sit
on stool</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) her trusted friend&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> At so much per annum, paid quarterly.
Sir Joseph has confided the government
of his household to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>proudly</i>) I am not a member of
your household, madam! I take orders from Sir
Joseph alone&mdash;and then they come in form of
requests!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> You compel me, therefore, to inform
Sir Joseph of your truculent attitude&mdash;and demand
your dismissal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>rise</i>) Dismissal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> It would of course be within my
province to dismiss you myself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>up to her</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Insolent!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> But I shall leave that disagreeable
duty to Sir Joseph; and I have no doubt that it
will come, as you say, in the form of a request. I
have the honour to wish you good morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Why, Treaby, what's the matter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>stamping her foot</i>) How dare you
call me Treaby!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> Oh, I beg your pardon&mdash;but Margaret
always does.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> Am I to be forever insulted in this
house? First by a wretched servant&mdash;then by
a mere boy!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> A boy&mdash;hang it! I shall be a full-fledged
doctor soon. But I apologise&mdash;there!
And Martelli's a hedgehog. Leave off sobbing
(<i>over back of settee</i>) do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>through her tears</i>) I will tell Sir
Joseph he must choose between her&mdash;and me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> She's an awful Tartar&mdash;I wonder my
uncle puts up with her. But come now, dear
Miss&mdash;Evangeline&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>coyly</i>) Mr. Swenboys?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>) Did you give Margaret
those verses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> I did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>excited, away</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Well? Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> She&mdash;laughed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>aghast</i>) Laughed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> But really&mdash;why did you steal them
from Swinburne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) The devil! She spotted
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> Naturally. She adores Swinburne.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> I altered a word or two&mdash;I did, I
swear. And of course poetry's not in my line.
But I didn't think girls were allowed to read
Swinburne!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> An old-fashioned prejudice. To-day
we throw open the whole book of life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> I didn't know! (<i>returning to back
of settee</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) But&mdash;Miss Treable&mdash;you're my
friend, aren't you? You'll help me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> I am always on the side of love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> Have I a chance, do you think? A
millionth part of a chance?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> You never speak to her!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> How can I? She's too&mdash;magnificent&mdash;she
dazzles me! Her eyes scorch me&mdash;I become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
idiotic! I can talk, as a rule, I've something to
say&mdash;but not to her, not to her! Although Martelli
thinks&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> Martelli! That hateful name! Oh!</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>(<i>Her sobs begin again.</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>enters from

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Oh Everard! Have you got
the flowers&mdash;the white roses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> Yes, here they are. (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> How good of you. (<i>turning to</i>
<span class="smcap">Miss Treable</span>, <i>and throwing her arms round
her</i>) What, dearest Treaby! Crying!&mdash;(<i>cross</i>
<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>coming</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Martelli has upset her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Again! Oh, the wretch! How I
wish that my guardian would send her away!
(<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> You have only to&mdash;to&mdash;to ask!
Could he&mdash;is there a man who&mdash;who could&mdash;anything,
anything, Margaret! Oh!</p>

<p class="center"><i>(He flies, overcome with confusion, and</i> <span class="smcap">Exit</span>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Poor Everard! (<i>she gazes pensively
after him for a moment&mdash;then turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss
Treable</span> <i>again</i>) Do not cry! I will speak to
Sir Joseph; he shall see that this woman makes
me unhappy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>drying her eyes</i>) Dearest Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span> (<i>looking around&mdash;sitting chair</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)
Oh, how my heart beats when I find myself in
his room!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> He is the grandest, greatest of
men&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> In this morning's paper they men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>tion
his name three times. And they've his portrait
in the Sketch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> And so like him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> His speech in that copyright case
yesterday! His triumph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> I felt you quiver as you sat beside
me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> He saw us there, I think.... As his
eye swept past, I noticed a tremble in his voice.
And, after that, I felt that he was speaking&mdash;for
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> His peroration was sublime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>rise, down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>and sit in chair</i>)
It was odious of that old man's daughter to thank
him so effusively. I detest Lady Claude!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>rising and</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Jealous, my Margaret?
They knew each other, in the long ago.
I have an idea that he once&mdash;but he has not her
photograph! I came here to see!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> It is not on the mantelpiece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> Nor in his desk. I looked!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh! You should not have done
that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> There is no limit to my devotion. It
is true Lady Claude is handsome.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>) Handsome! A
widow&mdash;and old! Why, she's thirty-five, at least!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>tartly away</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) My age, Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>rise and across to her</i>) Ah, dear
Treaby, forgive me! But&mdash;when I am here&mdash;in
his room&mdash;and think of&mdash;a possible rival! (<i>up to
desk</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Here, where he sits, and works! Every
day I steal in, and let fall a flower. I love to
think of him kissing that flower, perhaps&mdash;who
knows, wearing it next his heart! If he only
would speak to me! Little girl, he calls me, then
turns his eyes timidly away. Little girl! Oh
never did lover's epithet sound so sweet!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">(<i>Since having the flowers</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>has been undoing
them and dropping them about the room</i>.)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>sit on settee</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) I have seen him,
when your name was mentioned, change colour,
and murmur something beneath his breath.</p>

Oh, what?</p>

(<i>rise and up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) I beseech you&mdash;leave me here,

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>round to</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span> <i>and embracing</i>

know! (<i>he sees</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>) Ah, little girl, you
there? Er&mdash;er&mdash;Mrs. Martelli and I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) I go, guardian, I go! But&mdash;one
word&mdash;for poor Miss Treable. She is the only
friend I have in the world!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>She goes out</i> <span class="smcap">L. 3 E.</span>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) There, you hear that? The only
friend she has in the world! Now, can I send her
away? (<i>up to desk and sitting</i>) I put it to you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<i>grimly</i>) Every companion Miss
Messilent has had has been her only friend. And
let the lady stay by all means, Sir Joseph. (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)
Only you will permit me to take my departure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>very annoyed, sitting at his desk, taking
up the rose and dropping it in the waste-paper
basket</i>) I wish that girl wouldn't let her confounded
flowers trail all over the place! Why
does she come in here? Can't I have one room
in the house to myself?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<i>picking up flowers which</i> <span class="smcap">Margaret</span>
<i>has dropped</i>) That was precisely the cause of my
altercation with Miss Treable, Sir Joseph. I
found her inspecting the photographs on the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Confound her impudence! I'll say a
word to her. We'd better keep the door locked
in future, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>adamant</i>) You will have to
choose, Sir Joseph, between Miss Treable and me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>wheedling, rise and down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Come,
come, Mrs. Martelli, you and I have been together
too long to allow a trifle like this to part us.
Besides, we're all going off in a day or two&mdash;Miss
Treable may get married in the Long Vacation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. M.</span> Married&mdash;she! She'll never see forty
again!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Won't she, though? Well, after all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
that's no concern of mine. <i>I</i> don't want her to
see forty again&mdash;for the matter of that I don't
want to see <i>her</i> again. But she's the girl's companion&mdash;and
the girl must have a companion&mdash;and
if the Treable woman goes I shall have to
find another companion. That's so, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> (<i>still adamant</i>) Sir Joseph&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> And I want to be off to Scotland to-morrow!
Come, come, Mrs. Martelli&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mar.</span> Sir Joseph, that person has made
use of certain expressions to me that render further
residence with her under the same roof impossible.
I regret it&mdash;for my dear husband's sake,
I regret it. But you will have to choose.</p>

you conducted my case. You were masterly!
Masterly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) You are very good, Mr. Mollentrave.
Our copyright law is intricate. (<span class="smcap">Mol.</span>
<i>crosses behind</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and undoes book</i>) It
was a very nice point (<i>he shakes hands with</i>
<span class="smcap">Lady Claude</span>) And you, Lady Claude, are you
pleased?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Need you ask, when my book
was in question! Rosamund is naturally proud
of her father's work!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) And I am especially glad of
the opportunity the case has given me of renewing
an ancient friendship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Yes&mdash;we are very old friends, you
and I! You have been abroad a long time?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Yes&mdash;in Italy&mdash;since my husband's
death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I trust you have now returned for
good?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>a step</i>) I don't mean to
part with her any more, Balsted! Italian cypresses
may set off a widow's weeds&mdash;but now,
that two years have passed! (<span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> <i>sits on
stool. He produces a book</i>) Balsted, I have
taken the liberty to bring you my book&mdash;the <i>casus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>

to you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>taking it</i>) I am very much obliged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>rubbing his hands</i>) "Mollentrave
on Women!" I venture to say it is in a
fair way to become a classic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) He has given away all our
secrets!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I was an observer from boyhood.
Like Dante, I fell in love at the age of nine. Unlike
Dante, I made notes. In the interests of my
self-imposed study I married three times. (<i>by
chair</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) In short, you will find, between these
covers, a most careful, complete investigation on
scientific principles, of the baffling, perplexing
creature known to us as <span class="smcap">Woman</span>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>in smiling protest</i>) Papa!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>a step</i>) Your pardon, my
child! You are, of course, the topmost blossom
of the spreading tree. You have inherited, if I
may say so, my mental energy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>fingering the book</i>) I am disappointed
that Lady Claude's photograph does not
figure as frontispiece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Ha, ha, very good! (<i>away</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and
returning</i>) But&mdash;in all seriousness (<i>takes book</i>),
Balsted&mdash;it is a guide, a hand-book, a Baedeker!
It conducts you personally to the most hidden
recesses of the feminine heart, opens every door,
strips every cupboard! (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) No marriage
license should be issued to the man who cannot
pass his examination in Mollentrave! (<i>Goes</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>
<i>to table and puts book down</i>) As a result there
would be cobwebs in the Divorce Court! You
practise there, by the way?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Heaven forbid! No&mdash;I am on the Chancery
side&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Ah&mdash;that's a pity&mdash;I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
have valued expert criticism. I am at present
revising the book for its next edition&mdash;which will
be the twenty-third!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>on his</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) The twenty-third?
Really!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> My dear sir, the work has been translated
into every living tongue. I am told there
are women's clubs where it is the custom solemnly
to execrate me after dinner. In Dover Street "to
be mollentraved" has passed into the language.
It means&mdash;to be found out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Papa, we must not take up
Sir Joseph's time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> On the contrary! And my interviews
with you have been too brief, these many years
past, for me to desire to curtail them. Besides,
I find myself to-day in a position of some perplexity&mdash;and
truly, should value your advice!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>archly</i>) Mine&mdash;or papa's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Both! Please sit down. Will you listen
to my tale of woe?</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> <i>sits settee</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Gladly. It is the least we can do
for you, after your magnificent service. (<span class="smcap">Mol.</span>
<i>gets chair</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>and sits</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<i>They sit.</i>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>sits up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>front of desk</i>) Well then,
here goes! As you are aware, I am unmarried.
Many years ago (<i>he looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Claude</span> <i>who
drops her eyes</i>) I loved a lady, who, very wisely,
preferred another. (<span class="smcap">Mollentrave</span> <i>points waggishly
to the book</i>) Ah, Mr. Mollentrave, had I
then been able to consult your work!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I was labouring at it for twenty
years before I gave it to the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> My misfortune to have been born too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
soon! Well, I settled down to single blessedness,
and worked hard. My existence was tranquil.
An elderly lady, widow of a man I had known,
kept house for me, and left me undisturbed. My
life was all work, with an occasional game at
bridge. I had never been a ... lady's man ...
the sex did not&mdash;let us say, appreciate me&mdash;and I,
while admiring them from a distance, have
avoided their closer neighborhood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> My dear friend, you have denied
yourself one of the most fruitful sources of amusement!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> That may be, but I am constitutionally
shy. And law and politics, you see, took up all
my time&mdash;I settled down&mdash;contentedly enough,
into old fogeydom. My one care was a nephew,
a good lad, who walked the hospitals and has just
passed his final exam. Well, so far all was untroubled.
But now comes the catastrophe. A
year ago an old friend of mine died in Australia&mdash;a
companion of my boyhood&mdash;and bequeathed
me&mdash;his daughter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>alert</i>) Ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> His motherless daughter! I received
her letter by the morning's post&mdash;she came in the
afternoon! A girl! Imagine it! My austere
dwelling invaded by a bouncing, flouncing girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>chuckling</i>) Terrible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> It <i>was</i> terrible. Lady Claude will excuse
me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>smiling</i>) Oh yes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> My feelings at that moment could only
be expressed in camera. There was no way out&mdash;he
had appointed me her guardian&mdash;it was a
sacred trust&mdash;I could do nothing. (<i>rise</i>) She
was too old to send to school&mdash;too young to live
alone. And here was I, to whom girls are esoteric,
mysterious things, of strange, uncanny ways&mdash;I,
who don't know what to say to them, how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
feed them or amuse them, I who go into no
society, have no small-talk, don't dance or play
ping-pong&mdash;here was I suddenly overwhelmed by
this avalanche of laces and muslins!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Heaven sent you a full-grown
daughter, without the expensive preliminaries!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Let us hope Heaven meant it kindly&mdash;but
there are occasions, doubtless, when even
Providence nods! Well, after a considerable
struggle with myself, I accepted the inevitable. I
moved from my comfortable bachelor's quarters,
took this house, found her a companion&mdash;who at
once proceeded to quarrel with the housekeeper.
I had to dismiss her and engage another&mdash;the same
story! (<i>sits on settee</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>by</i> <span class="smcap">Lady C.</span>) In twelve
months I have had five companions. To-day another
disturbance&mdash;for the sixth time I am bidden
choose between them&mdash;and I had hoped to go to
Scotland to-morrow. This may all sound very
trivial&mdash;but truly I'm in despair!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>laughing</i>) Poor Sir Joseph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>rise and go</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span> <i>Earnestly</i>) My
dear child, I can enter into our friend's feelings&mdash;this
is no laughing matter!&mdash;Tell me now, Balsted&mdash;what
is she like, your ward?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>puzzled</i>) Like? Like all other girls, I
imagine. I scarcely have looked at her. Pretty, I
suppose, in a feeble kind of way. I have said
good morning and good evening, taken her to an
occasional theatre, and allowed her to prattle.
She is only a child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>quickly</i>) A mistake! They <i>never</i>
are children!&mdash;How old is she?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Eighteen, I believe&mdash;or nineteen, perhaps&mdash;possibly
twenty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Of the sentimental order?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>laughing</i>) Truly, I've no idea!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> At least you can tell me her taste
in literature?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>searching in his memory</i>) Literature?
She reads a good deal&mdash;though what, I've
no notion. Stay, though&mdash;I remember, one night
when I couldn't sleep, taking a book of hers upstairs,
and having a superb night's rest. It was
Somebody's Love-Letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> The Englishwoman's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Yes. That was it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Good. Were passages marked?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> The pages were peppered with lines
and crosses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> The boards protected with a cover?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I rather imagine they were.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Notes scribbled on the margin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I fancy so&mdash;yes, I am sure! Heaps of
'em!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Clue No. 1. Perfect. (<i>triumphant</i>)
In her clothing she will affect the darker shades?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>with an effort at memory</i>) Er&mdash;yes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Fond of flowers?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> She litters the place with them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I have her! Devours poetry, of
course? Adores Wagner? Appetite languid,
member of the Stage Society, and worships
Ibsen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> The name's familiar&mdash;I've heard her
mention it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Of course! My dear fellow, I haven't
seen the lady&mdash;and I prefer, as a rule, to visit the
patient before pronouncing upon her case. But
here all is simple, and there is no further need of
analysis. She belongs to the large class, known
as <i>Invertebrate Sentimentalists</i>. (<i>away</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>rise and go</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) The deuce she does!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Harmless, my dear fellow&mdash;quite
harmless! Now tell me&mdash;your nephew?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Yes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Has he been here all the time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> The last month only&mdash;he studied in
Germany.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Good. A normal, healthy lad?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Quite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Age?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Twenty-four or twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> A little melancholy lately?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Ah! The fact is. I <i>have</i> noticed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> With the quickness of the trained
advocate you have guessed my drift! My dear
sir, your troubles are at an end. To restore your
tranquillity, all you need do is to&mdash;add the ward
to the nephew!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>gleefully</i>) By Jove! I should never
have thought of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> That is where <i>I</i> come in. You talked
of a will&mdash;she has money?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Admirable. Now listen&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> <i>rises and goes up</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>sit in chair</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>down stage</i>) It
will take you exactly ten minutes. You will send
for your nephew&mdash;meet him coldly&mdash;wave him to
a chair. A set frown on your face. You will tell
him severely you have detected his secret, (<span class="smcap">Sir J.</span>
<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) remarked his passion for your ward. You
will upbraid him&mdash;remember, his adoration is
certain! He will confess and beat his bosom.
Then you melt&mdash;and send for the maiden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>alarmed</i>) I? I speak to her?
Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> In the interests of celerity! If you
leave it to him he will bungle it. He will be abject,
and she tyrannical. She will say "no" for
certain, to see how he takes it. She will demand
time&mdash;in short, there will be delay. You will
find all this set down in my fourteenth chapter,
called "The Cat and the Mouse."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>rise and down stage</i>) I can't do it,
Mollentrave. I shouldn't know what to say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>rise, put chair back</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) You, the
great orator! Imagine you're addressing a jury
of&mdash;girls! Wallow in sentiment&mdash;reek of it!
(<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Put the boy's love&mdash;draw a pathetic picture&mdash;tears
in your voice, and so on! In a minute
she'll cry, and accept him! Oh, I guarantee
the complete success of the operation! And see
here&mdash;Rosy and I are going to Swanage to-morrow&mdash;why
not join us there, with the young
couple?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) That's exceedingly good of you&mdash;I
had meant to trot off to Scotland&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> You can't&mdash;at once! Remember&mdash;they
are engaged! But you can go in a day or
two, and leave them with us. The house is large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Really&mdash;that is too kind&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Copy for me, my dear fellow&mdash;They'll
be under the microscope, but they won't
know. (<span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> <i>comes down</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) And I'll
give the boy some wrinkles. You'll come?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>turn</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Does Lady Claude join in
the invitation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Most cordially.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> So that's all settled. (<i>He gets up,
goes to the back, and proceeds to wrestle with his
overcoat</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Claude</span>) Though I should

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> The book will tell you how dangerous
it is to invite a woman's assistance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> But suppose I seek the danger?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> There is a chapter on widows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Which I shall not read. There <i>you</i>

Sir Joseph, I thought you could not talk to

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I cannot&mdash;but there is one, all these
years, to whom I have said so much, and so
often!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> I am glad you have made an exception.
Well, you know where we live, at Swanage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I have not forgotten&mdash;I have a memory....
There was an elm-tree there&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Which still remains, though it has

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Isn't the world full of girls whom you

Aren't there a hundred thousand more women
than men in London alone? And must you
select, out of them all, the very one whom you&mdash;shouldn't?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>sinking his head</i>) That wretched
Treable woman has told you about the verses!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Verses! You stooped to verses!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>humbly</i>) I cribbed them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> An attempt to obtain credit&mdash;under
false pretences! Confess it then, degenerate boy!
You love my ward!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>drawing himself up</i>) Uncle, I do!
With every drop of my blood!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>delighted, but simulating great grief</i>)
Ha! It is true then!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> I was wrong&mdash;there is no doubt I

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I must decline to put it that way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>passionately</i>) Why did you let me
come here, and be in her presence, day after day?
How live in the same house with her, sit opposite
her at meals, and not adore? How look upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
that matchless face, listen to the sound of her
voice, its silvery music (<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) and not&mdash;fall
prostrate?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>making a note on his shirt-cuff</i>)
Matchless face&mdash;silvery music&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) I worship her, uncle!
She is the&mdash;very star and loadstone of my existence,
the&mdash;</p>

said all this&mdash;to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>mournfully</i>) To her not a
word! My fingers may have pleaded, as I passed
the bread and butter&mdash;my eyes may have spoken&mdash;but
my lips&mdash;never! The verses, the fatal
verses, merely compared her to the (<i>away</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>)
Capitoline Venus&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) And the Venus, I suppose,
wasn't in it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>up to him</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Ah, uncle, don't
make fun of me! I confess my fault to you
frankly&mdash;I know it was wrong&mdash;I've always
known it. Send me away, sir&mdash;I'll do what you
bid me. Get me a berth in Africa where the
climate's deadliest (<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>front of table</i>) I'll go
without a word&mdash;and you'll soon be rid of me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) But, my dear lad, I don't
want to be rid of you&mdash;and I'm not sure that I
altogether approve of the deadly climate scheme.
All I say is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> You can say nothing to me that I
have not said already to myself&mdash;ah, many times!
(<i>rise</i>) It was a presumption&mdash;a mad presumption.
Don't be too hard on me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>gravely</i>) Everard, I've tried to do my
duty by you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> You have been more than a father
to me. Be merciful, sir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I will, I will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> All I ask is&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> All <i>I</i> ask is that we now drop heroics
and descend to more commonplace ground.
Leave Olympus and return to the London pavement&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span> <i>bewildered</i>) I don't understand&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Why, after all, when one comes
to think of it, there is no especial crime in a young
man falling in love with a young woman&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) A young woman! Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> A young goddess, then&mdash;but still, it is
not unnatural. And, as I say, I don't see&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>springing wildly to his feet</i>) You
don't mean that there is a hope for me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> But I do, I do! I have reason to believe
that she is not altogether indifferent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>gasping</i>) Uncle!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Has she given you no sign?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>shyly</i>) When we played chess last
Thursday, she allowed her hand to rest on mine
for the appreciable fraction of a second&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>) You see! Mollentrave
on Women&mdash;the text-book on the subject&mdash;would,
I am sure, interpret that as encouragement.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> Uncle! Don't tell me that you
think&mdash;(<i>he rushes wildly about the room</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> But I do, I do! What's more, I am
convinced! Come, my boy, sit down. (<span class="smcap">Everard</span>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Oh, uncle, if you would!
One word from you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Very well, then&mdash;send her to me! At

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Now! The court of Love is sitting!

her to be quick!</p>

He's in love with my&mdash;with a lady, and the lady

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> <i>I</i> know, by what I call consequential

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>very volubly</i>) My dear Miss
Messilent, I find myself in a rather embarrassing
position. Your guardian, who as you are aware,
has, in the most charming manner possible, retained
all the shyness of youth in the presence of
your adorable sex, has deputed me to speak for
him, phrase his sentiments, express his pious desires&mdash;in
a word, act as his mouthpiece in introducing
to your notice a subject that I trust will
enlist all your sympathy. Have I your permission?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span> <i>her eyes roaming from him to</i>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>sitting</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) My dear young lady,
the sixty years that have passed over my head,
furrowing my brow and blanching my hair, give
me at least the privilege to address you with a
certain paternal simplicity, a mild but glowing
benevolence. Can you, without too great a
stretch of the imagination, look on me, for a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
brief moment, as though I were actually your
guardian?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>more and more puzzled</i>) If you
wish it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Ten thousand thanks. You simplify
my task. Because the theme on which I have to
dwell is not one that can be coldly attacked&mdash;scarred
veteran as I am, there are still feeble pulsations
in my heart when I breathe the magic
word&mdash;Love! (<i>He looks searchingly at her</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret</span>. (<i>startled</i>) Love! (<i>she throws a
quick glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Joseph</span>, <i>who dives down

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>with much sentiment</i>) Love! I
am fresh from hearing a man tell of his love&mdash;oh,
the word is too cold!&mdash;of his deep, overpowering
passion! Miss Messilent, I am still under the
spell! I have been the recipient, in my time, of
many confidences&mdash;but never have I met a creature
so absolutely enslaved by the divine emotion,
so eager a captive in the chains of beauty&mdash;as is
this lover&mdash;of yours! (<i>Both rise</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Of mine! Mine! Me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Who but you? Are you not&mdash;but
forgive me if my advocacy becomes too ardent!
(<i>puts chair back</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and goes up to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span>)
It is your guardian who should be saying these
things&mdash;but I speak for him, I am the reed into
which he has blown! (<span class="smcap">Marg.</span> <i>kneels on stool and
is facing</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span>) It is your guardian who wishes
to know whether this man, this lover of yours
(<i>comes</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) this man who yearns for you, who for
the last month has been your satellite, shining
with your radiance and dark with your darkness,
who has set up a temple in his soul whereof you
are the goddess&mdash;whether this man shall be flung
by you into the shadows of hopeless misery, or
be made immortal by the knowledge that you&mdash;return&mdash;his
passion!</p>

My dear&mdash;Margaret, I am really most glad&mdash;most
glad. And Everard&mdash;well, well, I need say nothing
about Everard. And now that we&mdash;know&mdash;will
you regard me as&mdash;inconsiderate&mdash;if I press

Dexter</span>!" <span class="smcap">Dexter</span> <i>enters from the inner room

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>Is sitting</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>table</i>) I have a
few corrections to make for the new edition.
Have you your note-book?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter</span> (<i>enters</i> <span class="smcap">L. U. E.</span> <i>producing it</i>) Yes,
sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Sit down, sit down. (<span class="smcap">Dexter</span> <i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>
<i>of</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>table</i>) By the way, you've written that letter
for me to Lord Contareen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> I have it in there for you to sign, sir,
with the others.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> What date did I fix for his&mdash;reappearance,
Dexter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<i>turning up pages</i>) I can give you
the exact sentence, sir. (<i>reading</i>) "You have
sown the seed, my dear sir, expect its germination
in about six weeks. Then I shall invite you to
examine the shoots."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Yes, that will do! that will do.
Couldn't be clearer. Now, Dexter, to return. I
don't quite like the sub-title of that new chapter
on Marriage, Dexter. Read it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> "The Marriage-Course. The First
Lap."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Exactly. It's too concrete. And
suggests other laps to follow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<i>chuckling</i>) Yes, sir. Lapses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>glancing severely at him over his
spectacles</i>) Dexter, this is not the first time you
have offended in this fashion. I beg it may be
the last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<i>contritely</i>) Sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Let me remind you that marriage
was not invented merely to give the comic man a
chance. Not a word, not a word&mdash;we need say no
more. (<i>Rise, crosses to bookshelves</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>taking out
book</i>) I want a new sub-title&mdash;something symbolic,
tasteful, and yet adapted to the gravity of
the situation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> How would "stage" do, sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> It savours of the theatre. My work
has a large circulation among Nonconformists.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> "Phase," sir?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>across to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>back of table</i>) Invariably
associated with the moon, or Napoleon. I
seek a word that shall happily suggest the first
disillusions of the young couple. Stay, I have it!
The "Marriage Links" we will call it&mdash;there you
have the symbol&mdash;and for sub-title:&mdash;(<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)
"The First Bunker." (<span class="smcap">Mollentrave</span> <i>rubs his

</p>

<p>(<i>Up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) It's wrong, my dear fellow&mdash;it's
wrong! To-day's Friday&mdash;she refused you on
Wednesday. Too soon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>) Mollentrave&mdash;I&mdash;(<i>down</i>
<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>emphatically, down</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) I have
promised that you shall marry my daughter. I
have assured you that I have no doubt whatever
as to her affection. Then why this&mdash;precipitancy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> She refused me very decidedly.
(<i>sits on settee</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> My poor Rosamund is a widow. (<i>up</i>
<span class="smcap">L. C.</span> <i>across</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>and down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Also she has had
the advantage of correcting my proof-sheets. She
has read that passion wins maids, and perseverance
widows. She follows the rule. Do the
same!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> I thought&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Every siege must be conducted on
scientific principles. You should now be back in
your trenches. Digging, sir&mdash;digging!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>) Look here, Lady Pentruddock
has asked me down to her place in
Shropshire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Her sister will be there&mdash;Muriel,
I mean, not Gladys. Muriel has charm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Granted. And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Your daughter knows Lady Muriel.
When she learns that I shall be under the
same roof with that fascinating person&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) I see, I see.
Well&mdash;(<i>he ponders</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> If I tell Lady Claude that I&mdash;er&mdash;accept
her decision cheerfully&mdash;eh?&mdash;and inform
her that I&mdash;Lady Muriel&mdash;don't you think?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>judicially</i>) The idea has merit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>humbly</i>) I got it out of the
book.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Of course. That goes without saying.
(<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Well, no harm can be
done. Though a line to me, from Pentruddock
Castle would have been better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Perhaps. But still&mdash;I say, you're
backing me up?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I'm supporting you admirably. I
have repeatedly expressed my delight at her
having refused you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>staggered</i>) I say!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I dwell with satisfaction on the
prospect of not seeing you again&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Look here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> And have more than once hinted at
a past that is probably strewn with forlorn Nancies
and Janes&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>aghast&mdash;rise</i>) By Jove!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> "To kindle the flame of love in the
feminine bosom"&mdash;I quote from the fifteenth
chapter&mdash;(<i>he presses the bell</i>) "the third party
should vehemently, and persistently, denounce
the person whom he desires to see enthroned."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> But still!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Leave it to me, my dear fellow, leave
it to me! I tell you it works like a charm!</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Cont.</span> <i>re-sits settee</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Martin</span> <i>comes in</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Inform Lady Claude that Lord Contareen
is here, and ask her to be good enough to
descend.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Martin.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>he goes</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Now see&mdash;when Rosamund comes, I
shall retire into the back room there, and write a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
letter. I shall give you three minutes. Then you
take your leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Quite so. Three minutes will do!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> And remember&mdash;be sprightly! Not
a trace of acidity! Persiflage is good&mdash;in moderation&mdash;<i>Bring</i>
in Lady Pentruddock's sister&mdash;but
don't <i>drag</i> her in! You understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Perfectly, perfectly. Oh yes, I
see. Gad, Mollentrave, I've always done what
you told me. But those Nancies and Janes, you
know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Tut, tut, women like a dash of
colour! Now mind&mdash;your visit to-day is merely
a p. p. c. card&mdash;the whistle that heralds the shunting
of the train&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Quite so. (<i>whistle</i>) I must remember
that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>rise, cross to</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Your line is delicacy.
You feel it only due to her, and so forth.
Your tone must be soft, mellifluous&mdash;a south wind
rustling over orange trees. Orange trees, mark
you&mdash;<i>not</i> cypresses!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>rise</i>) Exactly. Orange trees&mdash;<i>not
cypresses</i>. I see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>takes</i> <span class="smcap">Cont.</span> <i>across</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) Take no
notice of her confusion. Be bland, respectful.
Retire gracefully. (<span class="smcap">Cont.</span> <i>crosses to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>front of</i>
<span class="smcap">Mollen.</span>) A gentle pressure of the hand. No
more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cont.</span> (<span class="smcap">L.</span>) I'll do it. I'll do it! You're
wonderful, Mollentrave, but I say&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>quickly</i>) To what extent I ad&mdash;ad&mdash;advocate!
Funny, isn't it! (<i>up stage</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>a
step</i>) Besides, we're too old, and that sort of
thing&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>puzzled</i>) I beg your pardon&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>top of table</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Oh, nothing, nothing&mdash;a
joke that's all&mdash;mere persiflage! What I
wanted to say was&mdash;to break it&mdash;h'm delicately&mdash;that
I was going away too&mdash;to Lady Pentruddock's,
you know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Indeed? I hope you will have a most
pleasant time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Thanks&mdash;sure to, sure to! Seems
that her sister's there&mdash;Muriel, you know, not
Gladys. Fine woman, Muriel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>indifferently</i>) Very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>artfully</i>) Old friend of mine&mdash;and
I fancy that she&mdash;she&mdash;you see&mdash;well, I&mdash;and
I rather want to&mdash;eh, don't you think?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>clapping her hands</i>) Admirable!
Oh, I'm so glad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>quickly</i>) Nothing done yet, of
course! There still is time&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> My visit to-day is merely a kind
of&mdash;whistle, you know. 'Bout ship, eh? You
don't mind?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Mind? I! My dear Lord Contareen,
I assure you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> You've no objection, I mean, to
my going down there?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Far from it! Indeed, I should most
strongly recommend a change of scene. (<i>rise and
away</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>cunningly, down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) And
of actors, Lady Claude, eh, of actors? Ha, ha!
I'm anxious of course, that you shouldn't think
me&mdash;(<i>he pauses</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>Impatiently, sit on sofa</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Think
you what, Lord Contareen?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Not regard it as sudden, eh? Too
abrupt and that sort of thing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> On the contrary, I shall be delighted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>disconcerted</i>) Oh! delighted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> I assure you! I have the greatest respect
for Lady Gladys&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Muriel, Muriel&mdash;not Gladys&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Your pardon&mdash;I should have said
Lady Muriel. Let me declare to you, most earnestly
and sincerely, that you have my very best
wishes for your success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> Of course I've said nothing yet&mdash;but
once down there&mdash;weak man, charming
woman&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Let us know as soon as it's settled!
And I will congratulate you, with my whole
heart! Believe it, Lord Contareen!</p>

Mollentrave&mdash;just going, Lady Claude&mdash;au revoir!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Good-bye. And my love to Lady
Muriel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Contareen.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Quite so, quite so.
Good-bye, Mollentrave. I'm afraid I've made an
awful hash&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>on his</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) Good-bye, my
dear fellow&mdash;good-bye. (<i>in his ear</i>) She's piqued&mdash;she's
piqued! Spade-work&mdash;nothing like it!
(<i>aloud</i>) Good-bye!</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Contareen</span> <i>goes</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Mollentrave</span> <i>returns to the

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>very earnestly</i>) Papa, don't practise
on me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>blandly</i>) My child?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> There are so many specimens for you
to play with! Look on me as an exception&mdash;a
freak, if you like. But <i>I</i>, at least, am not a rule
of three sum!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>sitting on stool</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>patting her hand</i>)
My dear Rosamund!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>rise</i>) How <i>could</i> you imagine that
such an inane, idiotic creature as that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> It is certainly strange that he should
go to Pentruddock. Your resentment is justified.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>and across back of table to
down</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span> <i>scornfully</i>) Resentment!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I shouldn't be in the least surprised
if Lady Muriel secured him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Oh, she may have him, with all my
heart, and all my sympathy too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>slyly</i>) Of course, my dear, I'm
aware that <i>you</i> don't care for him. How could
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>smiling in spite of herself</i>)
You refuse to believe me? I cannot convince
you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>stroking her condescendingly</i>) My
dear&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) After all that has happened!
After what you have seen of my life! And you
really believe that I ever could care for this man!
That I, a creature with a heart and soul, am
pigeon-holed in your book, and bound to conform
to its maxims!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>fatuously</i>) On the contrary&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>up and down</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) Is it his title
appeals to you&mdash;his houses, his money? Years
ago, I was obedient&mdash;my husband, too, had a title&mdash;and
you know how dearly I paid for it....
Weave no webs round me! The fly has grown
wary&mdash;and it has had the advantage, too, of studying
the wiles of the spider!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I quite admit, my dear, that Contareen's
change of attitude is reprehensible&mdash;very.
And I have not the least doubt&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>smiling sorrowfully</i>) You are incorrigible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> My dear child! Since I tell you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Ah&mdash;I see that I shall have to provide
you&mdash;with material for a new chapter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Mollentrave,&mdash;awful&mdash;the little

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>sitting</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) No! No!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> She thought you meant <i>me</i>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Balsted, how could you! Why, when
I left the room she had accepted Everard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> And I sent the boy to her&mdash;he comes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
back, pale as a ghost&mdash;and says she's engaged&mdash;to
ME! (<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>table</i>)</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Lady Claude</span> <i>up</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>and down</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>convulsed with</i>
<i>laughter. Both men turn to her.</i>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>) My dear Rosamund,
your hilarity is misplaced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>contritely but still choking, sit</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>by
work table</i>) I'm very sorry&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Our friend has unfortunately entangled
himself in a most serious dilemma&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I! That's good! <i>You</i> did the proposing!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> You heard me&mdash;you even complimented
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>rise</i>) It flashed across me at the time&mdash;you
never mentioned his name!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>with an indulgent smile</i>) Not mention
his name! I!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> If she had accepted Everard, would she,
one moment after, have consented to marry me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Do not excite yourself, my dear Balsted!
What happened, I see it, was this. I dug
the hole, and gave you the tree to put in. You
popped in the wrong one!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> What happened, Sir Joseph, after you
heard the news?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lady C.</span>) I rushed on here at once.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Mollen.</span>) You've got me into this scrape&mdash;get
me out!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> My dear friend, my services are of
course at your disposal. But, truly, how could
you? The affair was so simple!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Well, one thing's certain at any rate&mdash;she's
not in love with Everard&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>) That's not certain
at all!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>impatiently</i>) What! When the little
fool's in love with me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> That's not proved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Not proved! When she wants to marry
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Didn't I tell you she was an invertebrate
sentimentalist? You forgot that. Had
you left her undisturbed in the belief that you
meant Everard, she'd have gone to the altar with
Everard. You persuaded her I had spoken for
you&mdash;she switched her love on to you. That's the
case in a nutshell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Preposterous!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> There you may trust my, let us say,
wider experience. But tell me, Everard! He did
not undeceive her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> No&mdash;heroics! She loves you, he says
to me&mdash;uncle, she loves you! He seemed to take
it for granted I <i>must</i> love her! And he hoped&mdash;we'd
be happy! You'll go now&mdash;at once?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I'm willing of course. Only let us
first, calmly, review the situation.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> <i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>table</i>.)
</p>

<p>Assume that I tell your ward bluntly of her mistake&mdash;well,
what's the result?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> That I'm free!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Yes! But at what cost!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Cost! What do you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> The situation of which you complained
this afternoon will remain, will it not?
And intensified&mdash;a million times. Nay, it will
have become&mdash;impossible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> All this is beyond me! he turns appealingly
to Lady Claude! Lady Claude!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> It is beyond me too, Sir Joseph&mdash;but
papa knows&mdash;he is infallible!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> The girl has confessed her love for
you. A love, mark you, that does not exist, but
that <i>my</i> explanation will call into being!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>pettishly</i>) Absurd!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> But it's true! Her feeling for you,
at present a mere wayward infatuation, will at
once swell into romantic passion. She'll begin to
wither&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Wither?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Fade on the stalk! Refuse her food&mdash;live
on poetry and tea! Be a martyr! Then
anæmia acts in. Doctors, nurses, cures&mdash;and all
the time, mind you, she's hugging an imaginary
grief!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>Impatiently</i>) But, why, in the name
of Heaven&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Heaven only knows. <i>I</i> didn't make
women&mdash;I have merely observed them. If you
don't believe me, ask Rosamund.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>demurely</i>) Sir Joseph knows, I
always agree with Papa.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>rise and up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) And, mark you,
more, when I tell her you meant the nephew, she
at once proceeds to hate the nephew.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>feebly</i>) Hate him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Inevitably.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Lady Claude!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Papa means that her vanity will be
piqued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Vanity!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Complacently the essential ingredient
of a young woman's affections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> The book says she will demand an
eternity to pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> A feminine figure of speech that resolves
itself into months! But think of those
months with her sighing, dying, crying! (<i>down</i>
<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>groaning</i>) What a catastrophe!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span>) You're sure&mdash;quite
sure&mdash;you won't marry her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>angrily</i>) Mollentrave! (<i>rising</i>) If
<i>this</i> is all the help you can give me&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>forcing him back in his chair</i>) Alternatives!
I merely suggest alternatives! You
don't marry&mdash;that's settled, agreed. But I see
no reason why you should not be&mdash;engaged!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>rising</i>, <span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> <i>sits him again</i>) Engaged!
You're mad!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>round back of</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>table</i>) Secret engagement!
You tell her&mdash;paternal again&mdash;you
give her a month to reflect. Secrecy all round&mdash;except
us. You bound&mdash;she free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> How does that help me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Follow me closely. (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>)
During that month you become&mdash;senile.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Senile! Why, hang it, I'm only forty-five!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> And she's nineteen! Strip off your
limelight&mdash;to her you're Methuselah! (<i>sitting</i>
<span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>protesting</i>) I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>breaking in impetuously</i>) My dear
friend, you don't really imagine that she loves
<i>you</i>? Whatever's real in her loves Everard&mdash;or
any other good-looking young fellow of his age
whom she chances to meet. What she admires in
you is your talent, your position, your power.
Very well, take them off!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>blankly</i>) How can I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I've told you&mdash;be senile. Fidgety,
crotchety&mdash;sensitive to draughts&mdash;dyspeptic&mdash;adore
your food. Flannel nightcap&mdash;false teeth&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>indignantly rising</i>) I haven't!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> <i>Imagine</i> you have.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> <i>re-sits</i>.)
</p>

<p>Speak of them often! Boil your milk! Retire at
nine, have your paper warmed. Tell her you mean
to resign the House, give up the Bar, live in the
country, ten miles from a station, and write a
book on Constitutional Law!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> All that, eh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> And dictate to her five hours a day!
Find fault with her spelling&mdash;be always finding
fault!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Lively for both of us! But look here&mdash;seeing
that she has lived with me for a year, and
I <i>haven't</i> been senile&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>with a petulant gesture</i>) Tut, tut,
tut! Hitherto, you've concealed your&mdash;little ailments!
But, now that you've won her, are sure
of her, you show yourself&mdash;as you are! (<i>rise</i>) Oh,
it's simple enough! And so much for frontal attack.
(<i>a step</i>) As for skirmishes, we'll ask
Rosamund to be good enough to flirt with the
nephew&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>turning to her</i>) To flirt&mdash;you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>merrily</i>) The poor boy will need
consolation. And if I can be of service&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>up to</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>of table</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>with a flourish</i>)
Within two days she has the boy at her feet!
Then your bride becomes jealous. Your tyranny
offends her&mdash;she begins to see you are old. Romance
drops off like paper from a damp wall.
Everard's coolness piqued her&mdash;she proceeds to
discover that she loves Everard. You in dressing
gown and slippers&mdash;he young Greek god. And,
after a month's steady digging&mdash;we arrive&mdash;at&mdash;the
real girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> A month....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> May be less, may be less! Finally,
explanation&mdash;you discover her in tears&mdash;you
play the noble Roman, release her unconditionally,
Rosamund sends Everard to her&mdash;you join
their hands. Slow music. Curtain. See?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>rise and down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) I don't like the idea
of an engagement, even though it be secret. But
look here&mdash;if I did this&mdash;how about Everard?
What should I say to him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>to bottom of</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>table</i>) Let him be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>lieve&mdash;as
he already believes&mdash;that you admire
what's-her-name&mdash;but mention the month's probation.
Hint darkly at possibility of happy ending.
(<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">R. C. L.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span>) Bring Everard down
to Swanage&mdash;I answer for the rest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>hesitating</i>) It sounds plausible&mdash;though
it's a fearful undertaking! But, before
deciding, I should like a word with Lady Claude.
Will you allow me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Certainly, certainly. I'll smoke a
cigarette down-stairs&mdash;my habit, before dressing.
(<i>cross up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) You'll find habits useful by the way&mdash;I've
one or two that I'll tell you. I'll see you
before you go!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>He retires cheerfully humming a tune</i>, <span class="smcap">R.</span>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) Lady Claude, I've asked for
this because&mdash;I scarcely know where I am, or
what I'm saying! Your father rattles on&mdash;he
seems convincing&mdash;he may be right&mdash;but my instinct
tells me that, in this fearful muddle, <i>you</i>
are the surer guide!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir. J.</span> You! If I spoke rather cynically this
afternoon&mdash;if I have grown to think rather hardly
of women&mdash;remember that there was one whom
I&mdash;loved&mdash;and she&mdash;wouldn't have me!</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Lady Claude</span> <i>makes a gesture</i>.)
</p>

<p>Oh, don't be alarmed&mdash;I won't drag up the past.
No doubt, then, I was merely a wild, impetuous
youngster, like my poor Everard to-day. But&mdash;I
have not forgotten&mdash;how deeply I&mdash;felt it....
And here I seem, through my carelessness, to have
created sorrow for two young lives.... I'm a selfish
man, of course&mdash;I've shown it plainly enough!&mdash;but
still I've tried&mdash;honestly tried&mdash;to do my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
duty&mdash;by both of them.... Now I am urged to
play an odious comedy&mdash;for it <i>is</i> odious, is it not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Deception can never be pleasant....
You have all my sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I need it, I need it! Women, after all,
are an unknown quantity to me. Your father has
compiled a series of tables, has dissected and analysed&mdash;he
may be right, I don't know&mdash;but I
want <i>you</i> to guide me! You, and you only!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>gently</i>) What can I tell you?
(<i>rise and cross</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>and sitting on stool</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) In the first place, this. Is it
not rather my duty promptly to undeceive the
girl, at any cost? Have I the right to&mdash;play with
her affections?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>hesitating</i>) Sir Joseph&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Remember, I loved her father. He entrusted
his daughter to me, his old friend.... To-day,
when I think of him!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> You want my honest opinion?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Then what I have to say is said in a
very few words. One should not trifle with the
heart of a girl!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> What am I to do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> It is you, and you only, who can decide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Tell me what you think!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> The poor child has probably long
adored you in secret. She will have read sentiment
into your very least words&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>with sudden recollection</i>) Ha! the
flowers on my table, day after day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Laid there by her each morning,
fondly, tenderly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Advise me! I will follow you, blindly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Do what is kindest!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> If I undeceive her&mdash;the picture your
father has drawn&mdash;and your father understands
women&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> What he says may be true of ninety-nine
out of a hundred&mdash;there is always the hundredth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> The hundredth&mdash;yes&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I
know her so little! The disillusioning process
<i>might</i> be effective?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> It might. One cannot tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>) Then shall I do it? Shall
I?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> You must know best.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>with deep feeling</i>) Rosamund, I am
appealing to you&mdash;for your help!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>very earnestly, rise</i>) Then, no! I
would do the honest, the straightforward thing!...
Go to her yourself, tell her&mdash;of the mistake&mdash;but
oh, so softly, so gently, (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) that her poor little
heart shall rest itself upon yours, and not feel&mdash;too
ashamed! Point out how unwise it would
be! Be so full of pity that the wound ... shall
be scarcely a bruise.... Be so tender, so human,
that her poor little tears shall freshen her heart,
and not scald it.... And let there be tears in your
heart too&mdash;and no trace of&mdash;laughter.... There!
That is my advice. But I may be wrong....</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> No, you are right&mdash;I feel it! I go at
once. (<i>round back of table to up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) You will
tell your father. (<i>coming down</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>of</i> <span class="smcap">Lady
C.</span>) And, my dear friend, my very dear friend, I&mdash;thank
you!</p>

<p class="center">ACT III.
</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p><i>The garden of</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Mollentrave's</span> <i>house in Swanage.
A low fence runs at back, with a thick
hedge; behind is the sea, to which a winding
path leads, down the rock. There are alleys
running to right and left.</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Treable</span> <i>is
seated on the tree</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span> <i>with</i> <span class="smcap">Dexter</span> <i>standing
before her. A week has elapsed since the last
Act.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Yes, Miss Treable, he is a great
man&mdash;a very great man! His powers of insight
are most extraordinary! I trust you do not
resent his&mdash;as it were&mdash;stripping off the pigment
and exposing the unvarnished canvas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>is sitting</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>tree trunk, haughtily</i>)
I have no doubt that what Mr. Mollentrave says
may be true of <i>some</i> women&mdash;but certainly not of
<span class="smcap">ME</span>!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<i>bowing</i>) You are naturally an exception.
His remarks must be taken as applying
generally to the sex. (<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> Regarded from <i>that</i> point of view&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Ah, Miss Treable, in my own
humble life I have derived the greatest benefit
from Mr. Mollentrave's teaching! And like all
geniuses&mdash;he is so modest! One of his most brilliant
aphorisms was&mdash;I say it with pride&mdash;inspired
by me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>indifferent</i>) Indeed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>resting on</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>tree trunk</i>) I
assure you. You must know that my wife has a
large circle of relations. I will confess to you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
that I somewhat resented their constant interference
in our affairs. I mentioned the matter to
Mr. Mollentrave. Without a moment's hesitation
that remarkable man dictated the line: "Marital
happiness begins when the wife's relations&mdash;leave
off!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>sarcastic</i>) Profound. Very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<i>sit on</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>trunk</i>) He has permitted
me to compile a little volume of extracts, "The
Mollentrave Birthday Book"&mdash;one coruscation
for every day of the year. A good idea, is it not?
(<i>rising</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Admirable! But I doubt
whether many women will buy the book. (<i>down</i>
<span class="smcap">R.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dexter.</span> (<i>moving off</i>) If all those who consider
themselves exceptions purchase it, Miss
Treable, I shall be perfectly satisfied. (<i>goes up</i>
<span class="smcap">C.</span>)</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>(<i>He goes through the gate.</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Joseph</span> <i>comes

Joseph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Good morning. I had hoped to
find Mr. Mollentrave here. Do you happen to
know&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Miss Tre.</span> Would you wish me to tell him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I should be much obliged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Oh, Joseph, dear Joseph, how could
you! Lying on the grass! (<i>puts basket down</i> <span class="smcap">R.

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">L.</span>) (<i>getting up. Miserably</i>) H'm
I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) Wicked man! With your rheumatism!
And no muffler! I found it in the hall!
Oh, naughty, naughty! (<i>she produces it from the
basket</i>) Here it is, sir! Put it on at once!
(<i>puts muffler round him</i>) (<i>taking him to</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)
(<i>he sits</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>trunk of tree</i>) And it's twelve o'clock!
I've brought your essence&mdash;here&mdash;and a spoon.
(<i>she produces them from the basket and feeds
him</i>) What would you do without me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Impossible to conceive!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> (<span class="smcap">she sits on his L.</span>) Take it, sir! (<i>he
laps it up piteously</i>) To think of you all these
years, having to look after yourself, and hide, because
he wouldn't let his little girl see how ill he
was! Oh, poor, poor! (<i>she feeds him a second
time and wipes his mouth with the muffler</i>) But
she'll take care of him now! Only wasn't it
wicked of you to slip off like that? You had only
dictated for an hour and a half!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I thought you were tired!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> (<i>with enthusiasm</i>) Tired! I could go
on forever! It's immensely interesting&mdash;fascinating.
Oh, how wonderful you are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>clearing his throat</i>) H'm&mdash;I&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Constitutional Law, one would think
would be a dry subject. To me it's a fairy tale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Er&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Perhaps because <i>you</i> are speaking!
You! Nouns and adjectives cease to be parts of
speech&mdash;they become parts of&mdash;you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>with a great effort</i>) I have frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
had occasion to remark to you, Margaret, that I
have a great distaste for sentimentality. I have
explained to you&mdash;the month of probation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> One week has expired. Has it been a
week? Can the days have flown so quickly?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> They have evidently contrived to. Although&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> (<i>rise, up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) See how the sun is shining&mdash;how
radiant the water is&mdash;and the sky! The
dancing sunlight! Oh, what does it say to you,
the sunlight! (<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>impatiently</i>) It says to me that it's
very hot&mdash;and that we're talking nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Oh, let us, for once! I've been so good!&mdash;Joseph,
you coughed! You must take a lozenge.
(<i>she produces a box from the basket</i>) You must!
Mr. Mollentrave says that you have the beginnings
of asthma.</p>

<div class="hangindent">

<p>(<i>She opens the box, takes out a lozenge, and
forces it between his lips. He swallows it,
pathetically.</i>)</p></div>

<p>Miss Treable and I are practising first aid, in
case you should fall down&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>savagely</i>) And why in the name of
goodness should I fall down?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Mr. Mollentrave told me that your limbs
are rather unsteady&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>clenching his fists</i>) Ah, Mollentrave,
Mollentrave!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> (<i>kneeling on his</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>She puts his arm
on her shoulders, fondly</i>) But have no fear, dear
one! You shall lean on me&mdash;I shall be your
crutch, your support! Oh, the thought of us two
in our cottage&mdash;just you and I! I dream of it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>growling, taking arm away</i>) No
dances&mdash;no theatres&mdash;not even a visitor&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marg.</span> Shall I want any of these&mdash;when I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>&mdash;you!
You, who have given up all&mdash;for my sake&mdash;for
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>fidgeting</i>) H'm&mdash;but still&mdash;I fancy
you'll find it dull&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> I? Never! You don't know me
yet&mdash;not altogether, I mean. Oh, if you would let
me speak to you&mdash;about myself&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>rise and cross</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>, <i>throwing lozenge
away&mdash;fretfully</i>) That theme is barred&mdash;by consent.
Don't you think you had better go back to
the house? Unless you would like to bathe?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>rise, firmly</i>) No&mdash;you do not
bathe&mdash;I shall not either. No pleasure in which
<i>you</i> cannot join, can henceforth be a pleasure to
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>turning up stage&mdash;groaning</i>) Come&mdash;we'll
go back to Law! (<i>he rises</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Yes, yes&mdash;let us! But stay&mdash;I have
a word to say to you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> More words?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Not of myself this time&mdash;nor of you&mdash;but
of&mdash;Everard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>with a gleam of hope</i>) Everard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>) Oh, Joseph, my
own Joseph, what a suspicion! Could you imagine!
Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>groaning again</i>) He is more of your
age&mdash;I thought&mdash;I told you I should not blame
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Never dare to hint at such a thing
again! I regard him&mdash;it is my duty to regard
him&mdash;with the serene, but affectionate eyes, of an&mdash;aunt,
(<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Aunt!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> And&mdash;I confess&mdash;it grieves me&mdash;to
see him&mdash;so much taken up with&mdash;Lady Claude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>) Ah, you have noticed&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Day after day he is with her&mdash;with
her all the time. She&mdash;ah, Joseph, you may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
not have observed it&mdash;but women have quick eyes!
Lady Claude was a friend of yours once, I know&mdash;but
she is a designing woman!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>angrily</i>) I say! Look here!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Oh, I mean nothing unkind. Women
of that age&mdash;she is <i>at least</i> thirty-five&mdash;naturally
crave to be&mdash;admired. And it is perfectly
plain to me that she&mdash;is drawing Everard on.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>grimly</i>) Really!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> She flirts with him outrageously!
She won't let him out of her sight! I've been
looking forward to finding him a wife&mdash;you and
I together&mdash;some girl who would make him happy....
But Lady Claude!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>cunningly</i>) Everard certainly seems
to admire her&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Is it not incomprehensible! She's
so old.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> H'm, if it's the disproportion of age
that shocks you, think of us! I&mdash;fifty&mdash;and you
nineteen!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>rise, and up to him</i>) My love
shall twine round you so softly that we shall
divide my youth&mdash;shall share it. And, in the
days to come, we shall ask&mdash;which one is old&mdash;Joseph&mdash;or
Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>sulkily</i>) Conundrums of that kind
will be useful, on winter evenings, with the wind
howling down the chimney, and the rain coming
through the roof&mdash;(<i>turn away</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>getting on</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.'s</span> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) There can
be no wind when you are near me, and no rain
can come through the roof of our love!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>throwing up his hands in despair</i>)
Oh, no more at present, please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>laying a hand on his arm</i>) You'll
speak to Everard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Why on earth should I?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> Joseph! Shall we let the poor boy
throw himself away on&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>laughing hysterically</i>) Ha, ha!
Oh, that's very good! Throw himself away on&mdash;Lady
Claude!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) (<i>offended</i>) You think it's
impossible? But I tell you I've seen&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> My child, we've talked nonsense enough
for one morning. Let's go. (<i>takes her hand and
is about to lead her away</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <span class="smcap">Mollentrave</span>
<i>comes in breezily up</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) Ah, there's Mollentrave.
I must have a word with him. Run on to
the house&mdash;I'll follow. (<i>giving her the basket</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Margaret.</span> (<i>fondly</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Come soon, dear one&mdash;come

they grow tired with waiting!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) You want me, Balsted?
All going well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>savagely</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>takes muffler off</i>) Oh,
wonderfully well. The way we're progressing is
extraordinary&mdash;very!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>his head on one side</i>) The trained
observer would almost detect a suspicion of&mdash;satire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Satire! Heaven forbid! It's true that
the girl grows fonder and fonder&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> She has only tasted the jam so far&mdash;but
the powder's working!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> She Josephs me from morning till
night! She'll be calling me Joey soon. (<i>down</i>
<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) No, no, Balsted! I should <i>not</i>
encourage her in the use of the diminutive!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>savagely</i>) Gurrh! Look here, Mollentrave&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Impatient person! I said a month,
did I not? So far but a week has passed&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Mollentrave</span>
<i>sits</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Another week will drive me
crazy. I dictate law to her&mdash;the dullest stuff I
can find&mdash;I tell you she likes it, she never wants
me to stop!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> You will forgive me, my dear Balsted&mdash;but
have we been quite&mdash;senile&mdash;enough?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Senile! Have I been senile? Haven't
I simulated aches and pains, and congenital insanity,
till I simply detest myself? Man, she
loves me the more for it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>airily</i>) Merely the first stage, Balsted!
Peeling!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I can't go on&mdash;I tell you I can't! The
fact is, Mollentrave, that you've been hopelessly
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>emphatically</i>) Events are following
exactly the path that I had marked out; they
are, with unerring precision, pursuing to a hairs-breadth
the line I had indicated in my mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>sarcastic</i>) Indeed! Then perhaps
you'll explain&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> My dear Balsted, believe that I make
not the slightest reflection upon your intelligence
when I remark that a general's plans are rarely
comprehensible to his subalterns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>pettishly</i>) This is not a case&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>rise and go</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Pardon me, but it
is. If I may borrow an analogy from your legal
jargon, I am the leader here, and you the junior.
Is that not so?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I have made up my mind. I shall tell
her the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Do&mdash;and they'll drag up her body on
Swanage beach to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Absurd!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Let that sentimental girl realize that
she has been fooled&mdash;she'll take her life. That's
certain. And as her hair's long she'll choose the
sea. (<i>away</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span> <i>and up</i> <span class="smcap">L. C.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Unfortunately I've lost my faith in you,
Mollentrave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>shrugging his shoulders</i>) That, of
course, is a pity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Am I not justified? See your great
scheme about Everard! She isn't jealous at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Has she spoken about him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Yes&mdash;she wants to find him a wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> And not a word about Rosamund?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> She thinks Lady Claude flirts with him,
and doesn't seem to like it. But, beyond that&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>) Beyond that! And
you complain! Balsted, that's love! The real
girl creeping up, through the cotton wool! My
dear fellow! Couldn't be better! It couldn't indeed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I don't know&mdash;she didn't speak like that
at all. And the boy has been odd&mdash;he avoids me&mdash;he
doesn't address one word to Margaret&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>with emphasis</i>) The boy follows
the rule! He nurses his passion. Rosamund consoles
him&mdash;she always talks about Margaret!
What more do you want? And the girl thinks
they flirt! He watches her hungrily&mdash;oh, I've observed
it!&mdash;he waits for his hour. You'll see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>with a gleam of hope</i>) You really
think that? You really think that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>sits on</i> <span class="smcap">Joseph's</span> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) I give you my
word I never believed matters <i>could</i> be so far advanced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Then perhaps I had better go on?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>rise.</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> <i>rises</i>) Would you
turn back, with the harbour lights in sight?
Look here, I'll knock off a fortnight! I ask for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
one week more&mdash;just one week! And before that's
out you'll have them both on their knees to you.</p>

<p>Rosamund, Rosamund! Balsted has been complaining&mdash;losing
heart! Tell us about Everard!
He's always talking of Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>sadly</i>) Always, always!
For hours at a time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>up</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>turning triumphantly to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir
J.</span>) Balsted!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>plaintively</i>) She's a very sweet girl,
and I'm fond of her&mdash;but&mdash;the subject's beginning
to pall!</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>off cries</i> "<i>Joseph</i>")
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> She's calling you, Balsted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>sulkily</i>) Let her call.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>off louder</i> "<i>Joseph! Joseph!</i>")
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> You must go to her, Balsted! Play

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I'd rather spend it in gaol, picking
oakum. (<span class="smcap">Margaret</span> <i>off</i>, "<i>Joseph!</i> <span class="smcap">Joseph!!</span>")
Oh, Mollentrave, if it were not for your daughter,
how I'd wish that I never had met you!</p>

<p class="center">(<i>He goes&mdash;miserably</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. 3 E.</span>)
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>coming down</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span> <i>shaking his head</i>)
And that man, Rosamund, is one of our most eminent
lawyers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) Papa, I must tell you&mdash;it's
strange&mdash;though Everard and I talk of
nothing but Margaret every day, from two till
seven&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Well?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>pathetically</i>) Think of it! From
two till seven&mdash;every day!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Science must have its martyrs! Tell
yourself that you're watching human love wriggle&mdash;under
the microscope!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Though he recounts, with minutest
detail, every word she has spoken to him since
they first met&mdash;what she said, what he said, how
she looked, what she wore, the gestures she made&mdash;still,
and for all that, I have a feeling at times,
a kind of idea&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>waving his arm</i>) My child, you
know my opinion of feminine intuition! In my
book I class it under the head of popular fallacies.
(<i>with a change of voice, and sudden energy</i>)
Rosamund, I imagine the moment to be almost
ripe for my grand coup! (<i>takes</i> <span class="smcap">Lady Claude's</span>
<i>hands and sits her</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>on his</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> What will you do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>sitting</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) I shall now proceed to
work on the clay. I will provoke Everard to
frenzy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> How?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> He knows of course of the month of
probation&mdash;he builds on that. To-day he shall
learn that Balsted proposes, at the earliest possible
moment, to lead Margaret to the altar!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>doubtfully</i>) You will tell him that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> I will. And the result? A scene between
the two young people before which the most
passionate episodes of Romeo and Juliet pale into
insignificance! For I shall also tell Margaret
that <i>you</i> have fallen desperately in love with
Everard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>protesting</i>) Papa! You will never
say that!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> Discreetly&mdash;by nods and jerks&mdash;oh,
you may trust me! And there ensues&mdash;in chemical
parlance&mdash;a liberation of two gases&mdash;that
meet&mdash;and explode!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>rise, up</i> <span class="smcap">C.</span>) Oh, I hope that they'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
explode soon! See, there he is&mdash;under the trees!
He is waiting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mollen.</span> (<i>rise and up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Let him come&mdash;I
will leave you. Prepare him, Rosamund&mdash;pave
the way&mdash;lay down the stones&mdash;then I shall come&mdash;the
steam roller! I have every confidence in
you, my child.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>He skips off nimbly</i> <span class="smcap">R. 3 E.</span>&mdash;<i>after an instant</i>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Ah, Everard&mdash;my father has
just left me&mdash;we were talking of Margaret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span> <i>on her</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) (<i>indifferently</i>) Ah?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> The sweet girl! How beautiful she
looks to-day!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> She has a certain prettiness&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Oh, Everard, her eyes! I don't think
I ever have seen such eyes! One moment so
tender&mdash;another so deep and glowing&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> As your father says, Lady Claude,
those qualities are common to the optic organs of
all mammals. And&mdash;let me ask you&mdash;<i>why</i> will
you always speak about Margaret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Because I admire her so much! She
has youth&mdash;ah, youth! (<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) And besides,
dear Everard, it seems to me that Margaret has
been a favourite topic&mdash;with us both!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>on her</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) To-day at least
I decline to talk of her&mdash;but of you&mdash;only of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> There is nothing to say of me, dear
Everard. I&mdash;was. Among you young people I
seem to move like a&mdash;tradition. Margaret says
the things I used to say&mdash;she dreams my dead
dreams. And I am fond of her&mdash;because I see in
her&mdash;my old self.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>eagerly</i>) That self has not suffered&mdash;time
only has mellowed it&mdash;wisdom has crowned
it&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>cheerfully</i>) You must not waste
those pretty speeches on me! And tell me, why
this affected indifference? Do I not know how
passionately you adore her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<i>rising</i>) Lady Claude, I will confess
to you, frankly and honestly, there <i>was</i> a
time when I believed I loved Margaret&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>staring</i>) When you believed&mdash;!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> As your father observes&mdash;quoting
Tolstoy, I think&mdash;I was attracted by a well-fitting
jersey and a pair of Paris shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Everard!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> But it was, I need scarcely say, the
merest infatuation&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> What!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> Could it have been other&mdash;since now
I am conscious&mdash;how wholeheartedly I love&mdash;you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>wildly</i>) Me! You love me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> You. My feeling for Margaret was
immature sex-attraction. At your feet (<i>kneeling
on her</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>) I lay the profound and reasoned devotion&mdash;of
a man. Rosamund, I love you. I ask
you to marry me. Be my wife!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>aghast and helpless, rise and cross</i>
<span class="smcap">L.</span>) You can't mean this? (<i>He tries to take her
hand, she rises hurriedly and eludes him.</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span>
<i>comes from</i> <span class="smcap">R. 3 E.</span>) (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) There is your uncle.
Leave us, leave us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) Why? I will tell him&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> No, no! Go to my father! Let him
know! Please!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Everard.</span> Since you wish it. (<i>He goes up</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>,
<i>passing</i> <span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> <i>haughtily</i>) I shall return for my
answer. (<i>he goes</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) He has proposed!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) What!!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Imagine it! He has fallen in love&mdash;with
me!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>slowly</i>) Everard has fallen&mdash;in love&mdash;with
you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Yes! Imagine it! A catastrophe!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>dully, down</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span> <i>and sitting</i>) Very
awkward. Very.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<span class="smcap">C.</span>) How could one conceive it!
I've been sympathetic&mdash;that's all! Talked about
Margaret! Oh, I assure you, I've done nothing
but talk about Margaret!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> There's something odd about boys and
girls nowadays. But, of course, it's all Mollentrave&mdash;(<i>he
clenches his fist</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> What must I do? Tell me&mdash;advise
me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> You haven't accepted him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>) Sir Joseph!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> You see, things are just a trifle topsy-turvy.
My&mdash;bride&mdash;grows more and more devoted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> I'm completely bewildered! The poor
boy seemed terribly in earnest&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> So does the poor girl! I'd like to shake
them both in a bag! Well, <i>you'll</i> have a week of
it now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> How to refuse him without&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> You'd better accept him&mdash;why not?
You'll find, we'll both have to marry them. Then,
some day perhaps, they'll elope together&mdash;and
Mollentrave on Women will rub his hands and
cry "There!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>very distressed</i>) What am I to say
to Everard? Oh, what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> Be senile! Boil your milk!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> (<i>indignantly</i>) Sir Joseph! Is this
your sympathy? (<i>sit</i> <span class="smcap">L.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>meekly and deprecatingly, rise and to</i>
<span class="smcap">L. C.</span>) My dear friend, I've had seven days of
Margaret. I thought my brain was fairly strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
&mdash;but it's giving. I tell you I'm growing helpless&mdash;turning
to pulp&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> But advise me&mdash;advise me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I can't. You know&mdash;it sounds absurd&mdash;I
did have some hopes of marrying you myself&mdash;I
did indeed. (<i>away</i> <span class="smcap">R.</span>) Well, now Everard
claims you&mdash;and I shall soon be led by Margaret
to the altar, with Miss Treable propping me up
on the other side. We can't do anything&mdash;that's
how matters are!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Do you think <i>I</i> will marry Everard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> (<i>helplessly sit</i> <span class="smcap">R. C.</span>) I don't know&mdash;I

Rosamund, wait for me here. I have news&mdash;strange

Rosamund, I'll go now to the post-office,

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> No, no, it's impossible! Oh, Joseph,
think of our eternal remorse&mdash;if anything happened!</p>

we shall both of us be caught!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> We should never have lent ourselves
to this deception!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> It's too late now to moan over things!
Your father's responsible for it all&mdash;let him put
things right!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady C.</span> Think of poor Margaret! Ninety-nine
girls out of a hundred, I said&mdash;what if she
be the hundredth?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir J.</span> I don't care if she be the thousandth!
I won't marry her!</p>

his fat hook and thinks he has landed the salmon&mdash;down
below, a barefoot boy wades in, and captures
the prize! As a lover, Balsted, you have
every quality&mdash;every one in the world that appeals
to a beautiful girl&mdash;every one, with the exception
of youth!</p>
